## Problem Statement

Atliq, a computer hardware manufacturer, is experiencing declining sales, contrary to the reports provided by regional managers. Atliq's headquarters in Delhi, India, struggles to get meaningful insights from the vast amount of sales data coming from its regional offices across North, South, and Central India. Despite receiving numerous Excel sheets from regional managers, these reports lack actionable insights.

The objective of this project is to build a comprehensive dashboard that provides Atliq HQ with clear insights into sales data across different regions. This dashboard will help identify the root causes of the sales decline and provide actionable insights for improvement.

Purpose: To uncover actionable insights from sales data.
Stakeholders: Atliq HQ and regional managers.
End Result: A Power BI dashboard providing clear sales insights.
Success Criteria: Accurate, actionable insights leading to informed decision-making.
Downloaded and installed MySQL to manage the sales data.
Imported and queried data within MySQL to gain an initial overview.
## 2. Data Cleaning and ETL:
Cleaned and transformed the data, converting currency from USD to INR.
Removed duplicate currency entries in the transactions table.
Created a star schema for efficient data modeling, establishing proper database relationships.

Real-time Data Streaming: Upgrade the system to support real-time data streaming for up-to-the-minute insights.
## Conclusion
This Sales Insights Analysis Project provides Atliq HQ with a powerful tool to monitor and analyze sales data effectively. The dashboard enables data-driven decision-making, helping to reverse the sales decline and steer the company toward growth.
